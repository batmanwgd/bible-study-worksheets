# Bible Study Worksheets

This repo contains study guides intended for use in weekly adult Bible study classes in churches. These study guides have been used in the weekly adult education classes at [Meadowlands Baptist Church](http://www.meadowlandsbaptist.ca/). 

## Note on worksheet format

The worksheets for the gospel of Mark were the first that I wrote. Mark was also the first longer book that we attempted at the church, and past worksheets had always included the biblical text of the passage to be studied on one side. In those worksheets, I was experimenting with an awkward compromise to include the text of the gospel itself with a few study questions inserted in the margin. This approach was not popular, because space constraints didn't allow me to include questions that were very thought-provoking. Since then, I've omitted the biblical text from the worksheets for longer books, opting to include a summary of the passage and a display of the overall outline of the book instead. For shorter books, I have often reverted to the practice of including the biblical text on the front side for markup and study purposes.

## ZIP archives

In most cases, a ZIP archive of the worksheets containing versions in Word and PDF format is available in the "zip archives" folder.

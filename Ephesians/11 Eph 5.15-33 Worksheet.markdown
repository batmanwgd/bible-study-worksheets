**Ephesians 5:15–33 (NKJV)**

See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, ^16^ redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

^17^ Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. ^18^ And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, ^19^ speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, ^20^ giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ^21^ submitting to one another in the fear of God.

^22^ Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. ^23^ For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. ^24^ Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so *let* the wives *be* to their own husbands in everything.

^25^ Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, ^26^ that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, ^27^ that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. ^28^ So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. ^29^ For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord *does* the church. ^30^ For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. ^31^ “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” ^32^ This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. ^33^ Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife *see* that she respects *her* husband.

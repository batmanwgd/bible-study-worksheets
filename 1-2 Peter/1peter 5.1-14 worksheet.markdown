**1 Peter 5:1–14 (NKJV)**

The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed: ^2^ Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; ^3 ^nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock; ^4^ and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.

^5^ Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to *your* elders. Yes, all of *you* be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for

> “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.”

^6^ Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, ^7 ^casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.

^8^ Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. ^9^ Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. ^10^ But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle *you* . ^11^ To Him *be* the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

^12^ By Silvanus, our faithful brother as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.

^13^ She who is in Babylon, elect together with *you*, greets you; and *so does* Mark my son. ^14^ Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

What does Peter mean when he calls himself “a partaker of the glory that will be revealed” (5:1)?

In verses 2 and 3, Peter describes the manner in which an “elder” (pastor) should “shepherd the flock of God.” Explain why each one of these things would be important for a pastor to remember.

Why would the reminder about the future “crown of glory” (5:4) be particularly encouraging for the pastors to whom Peter wrote? How might this reminder encourage today’s pastors?

In 5:5, Peter quotes from Proverbs 3:34 (which is also quoted in James 4:6). List some ways that God could “resist the proud” today. How does that contrast with ways in which He “gives grace to the humble”?

In 5:8, Peter mentions the devil, who is otherwise unmentioned in the book of 1 Peter. Reflect on what it would have meant to the original audience to be told that their real “adversary” was the devil.

Explain how it can be possible to “resist” the devil (5:9), including any statements from the nearby context that might support your explanation.

Peter concludes the body of his letter by ascribing “the glory and the dominion forever and ever” to God. Why is this an appropriate ending for 1 Peter?

Verse 13 includes the cryptic reference to “she who is in Babylon.” What might Peter be saying with this phrase?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of 1 Peter 5:1–14 for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

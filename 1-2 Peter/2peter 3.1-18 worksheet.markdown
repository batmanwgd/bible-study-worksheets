**2 Peter 3:1–18 (NKJV)**

Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in *both of* which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), ^2^ that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, ^3^ knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, ^4^ and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as *they were* from the beginning of creation.” ^5^ For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, ^6^ by which the world *that* then existed perished, being flooded with water. ^7^ But the heavens and the earth *which* are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

^8^ But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day *is* as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. ^9^ The Lord is not slack concerning *His* promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.

^10^ But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. ^11^ Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner *of persons* ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, ^12^ looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? ^13^ Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

^14^ Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless; ^15^ and consider *that* the longsuffering of our Lord *is* salvation—as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, ^16^ as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which untaught and unstable *people* twist to their own destruction, as *they do* also the rest of the Scriptures.

^17^ You therefore, beloved, since you know *this* beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked; ^18^ but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him *be* the glory both now and forever. Amen.

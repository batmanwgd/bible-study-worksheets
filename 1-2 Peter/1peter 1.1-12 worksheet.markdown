**1 Peter 1:1–12 (NKJV)**

Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To the pilgrims of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, ^2^ elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.

^3 ^Blessed *be* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, ^4^ to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, ^5^ who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.

^6^ In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, ^7 ^that the genuineness of your faith, *being* much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, ^8 ^whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see *Him*, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, ^9^ receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of *your* souls.

^10^ Of this salvation the prophets have inquired and searched carefully, who prophesied of the grace *that would come* to you, ^11 ^searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of Christ who was in them was indicating when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow. ^12^ To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to us they were ministering the things which now have been reported to you through those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things which angels desire to look into.

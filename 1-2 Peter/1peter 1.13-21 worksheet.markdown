**1 Peter 1:13–21 (NKJV)**

Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest *your* hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; ^14^ as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, *as* in your ignorance; ^15^ but as He who called you *is* holy, you also be holy in all *your* conduct, ^16^ because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”

^17^ And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay *here* in fear; ^18^ knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, *like* silver or gold, from your aimless conduct *received* by tradition from your fathers, ^19^ but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot. ^20^ He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you ^21^ who through Him believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

The word “therefore” frequently introduces a portion of text that is logically supported by a preceding passage. Review vv. 1–12 and decide which verses function as the logical ground for vv. 13 and following.

What does Peter mean with the metaphor, “gird up [lit., bind up] the loins of your mind” in v. 13? You may want to consult a study Bible or compare a variety of English translations for some insight.

What is the relationship between thought (v. 13) and action (v. 14) in Peter’s exhortation to his readers?

List the reasons Peter supplies in vv. 15–16 for the commands in vv. 13–14. Is there any situation in life when these reasons might not apply?

What does it mean to “conduct yourselves… in fear” in v. 17?

In vv. 18–19, Peter contrasts something he calls “corruptible things” with “the precious blood of Christ.” What is he talking about when he says “corruptible things,” and how does that contrast with Christ’s work on our behalf?

Based on the context, what do you think it was about Christ that God “foreordained before the foundation of the world”? (v. 20)

Why do Christians, who have both “faith and hope… in God” (v. 21), still struggle with doubt and despair?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of 1 Peter 1:13–21 for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

**1 Peter 1:22–2:3 (NKJV)**

Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart, ^23^ having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever, ^24^ because

> “All flesh *is* as grass,
>
> And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass.
>
> The grass withers, And its flower falls away,
>
> ^25^ But the word of the LORD endures forever.”

Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you. ^2:1^ Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, ^2^ as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, ^3^ if indeed you have tasted that the Lord *is* gracious.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

In 1:22, Peter appears to be assuming that you have responded to God in several specific ways. What are those responses, and can you honestly say that Peter’s assumption is true of your own life?

Notice the contrast between human and divine responsibility in 1:22–23. What do these verses indicate that God has done in the life of a believer, and is there any reason to doubt God’s faithfulness in doing these things?

In 1:24, Peter quotes from Isaiah 40:6–8. Why do you think it was important for Peter’s first readers to understand that “all flesh is as grass”?

Explain why it is true that “the word of the Lord endures forever” (1:25) in contrast with human weakness and finiteness (1:24).

Why does Peter point out that the gospel is based on God’s enduring word in 1:25b? How would this be encouraging?

Use a Bible concordance, computer software, or cross-reference list to locate other references to “malice,” “deceit,” “hypocrisy,” “envy,” and “evil speaking” (2:1). What else can you learn from Scripture about these actions?

How might “laying aside” all the things listed in 2:1 be related to desiring “the pure milk of the word” in 2:2?

How have you experienced the kindness of the Lord (2:3) in your own life?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of 1 Peter 1:22–2:3 for your own life today.*

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

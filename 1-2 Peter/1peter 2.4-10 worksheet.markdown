**1 Peter 2:4–10 (NKJV)**

Coming to Him *as to* a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God *and* precious, ^5^ you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. ^6^ Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture,

> “Behold, I lay in Zion
>
> A chief cornerstone, elect, precious,
>
> And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.”

^7^ Therefore, to you who believe, *He is* precious; but to those who are disobedient,

> “The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone,”

^8^ and

> “A stone of stumbling And a rock of offense.”

They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.

^9^ But you *are* a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; ^10^ who once *were* not a people but *are* now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy.

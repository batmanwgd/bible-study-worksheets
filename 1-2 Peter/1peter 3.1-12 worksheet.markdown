**1 Peter 3:1–12 (NKJV)**

Wives, likewise, *be* submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives, ^2^ when they observe your chaste conduct *accompanied* by fear. ^3^ Do not let your adornment be *merely* outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on *fine* apparel—^4^ rather *let it be* the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible *beauty* of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. ^5^ For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, ^6^ as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.

^7^ Husbands, likewise, dwell with *them* with understanding, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as *being* heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.

^8^ Finally, all *of you be* of one mind, having compassion for one another; love as brothers, *be* tenderhearted, *be* courteous; ^9^ not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. ^10^ For

> “He who would love life

> And see good days,
>
> Let him refrain his tongue from evil,
>
> And his lips from speaking deceit.
>
> ^11^ Let him turn away from evil and do good;
>
> Let him seek peace and pursue it.
>
> ^12^ For the eyes of the LORD *are* on the righteous,
>
> And His ears *are open* to their prayers;
>
> But the face of the LORD *is* against those who do evil.”

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

By what means does Peter suggest that those husbands who “do not obey the word” might “be won” (v. 1)? Why does he say that this could happen “without a word” (v. 1)?

Explain the relationship between outer physical adornment and inner spiritual adornment in verses 3–4. Is Peter prohibiting women from maintaining an attractive appearance? Why or why not?

What is attractive about submission to a husband (v. 5), and how was Sarah’s relationship to Abraham exemplary (v. 6)?

How important is a husband’s relationship with his wife (v. 7)? What does it mean to be “heirs together of the grace of life” (v. 7)?

Why is it appropriate for Peter to conclude this section of practical exhortation (2:11–3:7) with a call to Christian unity in 3:8?

In verse 9, Peter gives two reasons why we should bless those who do evil to us. What are those reasons, and why are they significant for us?

In 3:10–12, Peter cites Psalm 34:12–16. Read Psalm 34 and consider what made this psalm so applicable to Peter’s audience and message.

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of 1 Peter 3:1–12 for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

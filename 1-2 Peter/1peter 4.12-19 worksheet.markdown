**1 Peter 4:12–19 (NKJV)**

Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; ^13^ but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. ^14^ If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed *are you*, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. ^15^ But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. ^16^ Yet if *anyone suffers* as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.

^17^ For the time *has come* for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if *it begins* with us first, what will *be* the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? ^18^ Now

> “If the righteous one is scarcely saved,
>
> Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?”

^19^ Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls *to Him* in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.

What is it that Peter describes as a “fiery trial” (v. 12)? Can you find any hints within the surrounding context?

What is the single common feature of the various things that Peter prohibits in v. 15?

Why is there a contrast between the kind of suffering described in v. 15 and the kind of suffering described in v. 16?

What is Peter describing as the “house of God” (v.17)? How can Peter say that God is beginning judgment there?

In v. 18, Peter quotes Proverbs 11:31. What does it mean to be “scarcely saved”? (You may wish to compare a variety of translations for some insight.)

According to v. 19, every persecuted Christian should draw strength and confidence from what source?

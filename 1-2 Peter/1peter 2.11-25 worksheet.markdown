**1 Peter 2:11–25 (NKJV)**

Beloved, I beg *you* as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, ^12^ having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by *your* good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.

^13^ Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme, ^14^ or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and *for the* praise of those who do good. ^15^ For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men—^16^ as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God. ^17^ Honor all *people*. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.

^18^ Servants, *be* submissive to *your* masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. ^19^ For this *is* commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully. ^20^ For what credit *is it* if, when you are beaten for your faults, you take it patiently? But when you do good and suffer, if you take it patiently, this *is* commendable before God. ^21 ^For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:

> ^22^ “Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth”;

^23^ who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed *Himself* to Him who judges righteously; ^24^ who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed. ^25^ For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

What does the identity of Peter’s readers as “sojourners and pilgrims” have to do with the command in 2:11?

In 2:12, Peter identifies a specific result that will occur when Christians display godly conduct within society. What does Peter say this result will be, and what does that suggest about the implications of our actions?

To what extent did Peter expect the early church to obey authorities (2:13–14)? Given that they lived in an authoritarian society and we live under democratic law, do we have any reason to believe that our responsibilities are somehow different?

What does it mean to be both “free” and “bondservant of God” (2:16)? Explain how this relates to submission to government in 2:13–14.

What makes suffering under harsh masters “commendable” (2:19)?

How does the suffering of Christ serve as an “example” to us in suffering (2:21)? Is Peter suggesting that you can/should remain sinless as you suffer? Why or why not?

What does it mean for us to have “died to sins” and be able to “live for righteousness” (2:24)?

Why does Peter refer to God as “the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls” in 2:25? How would those metaphors encourage his original readers?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of 1 Peter 2:11–25 for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

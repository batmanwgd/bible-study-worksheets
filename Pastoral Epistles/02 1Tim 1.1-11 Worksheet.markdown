**Worksheet \#2: 1 Timothy 1:1–11 (NKJV)**

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,

^2^ To Timothy, a true son in the faith:

Grace, mercy, *and* peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

^3^ As I urged you when I went into Macedonia—remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine, ^4^ nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. ^5^ Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, *from* a good conscience, and *from* sincere faith, ^6^ from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, ^7^ desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm.

^8^ But we know that the law *is* good if one uses it lawfully, ^9^ knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for *the* lawless and insubordinate, for *the* ungodly and for sinners, for *the* unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, ^10^ for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, ^11^ according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.

2.  In what sense is God “our Savior” and Christ “our hope” (v. 1)?

3.  What does Paul insist that teachers of “other doctrine” and “fables and endless genealogies” produce in their hearers (v. 3–4)?

4.  What does Paul describe as the result of teaching “the commandment” (v. 5)? Based on the context, what is “the commandment”?

5.  What is “the law” described in v. 8, and how does one “use it lawfully”?

6.  What is the function of the law for “the lawless and insubordinate” (v. 9ff)?

7.  How does Paul define “sound doctrine” (v. 10)? What serves as the standard for determining whether a teaching is sound or unsound?

8.  What is the “glorious gospel of the blessed God,” and why does Paul describe it this way (v. 11)?

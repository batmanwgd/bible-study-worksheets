**Worksheet 2: 1 Thessalonians 1:1–10 (NKJV)**

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,

To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

^2 ^We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, ^3 ^remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father, ^4 ^knowing, beloved brethren, your election by God. ^5 ^For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.

^6 ^And you became followers of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit, ^7 ^so that you became examples to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe. ^8 ^For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place. Your faith toward God has gone out, so that we do not need to say anything. ^9 ^For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, ^10 ^and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, *even* Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.

Background: *You may want to consult a study Bible or Bible dictionary for help with these questions.*

Compare several translations of vv. 2 and 3. Where do different translations place the word translated “without ceasing” (NKJV) or “constantly” (others)? Which position do you think makes the most sense, and why?

How should we understand the phrases “work of faith,” “labor of love,” and “patience of hope” in verse 3? For instance, what is the relationship between “work” and “faith” here?

How could Paul be so confident of the Thessalonians’ election (1:4)? What assurances does he mention in this context that would support such a conclusion?

How should we understand the contrast between a gospel that came not only “in word” but also “in power” (v. 5)?

In what way were the Thessalonian believers an “example to all in Macedonia and Achaia who believe” (v. 7)? How can an entire congregation make an impact on believers elsewhere? Why would this be significant in this letter?

Why might Paul be reminding these believers of their dramatic conversion experience (v. 9; *cf.* Acts 17:1–10)? What does this suggest about current situation that Paul addresses in this letter?

In what ways would the future deliverance from divine wrath through Jesus (v. 10) encourage the believers in Thessalonica? Compare with 1 Thess. 5:9 and 2 Thess. 1:6–10 for some additional context.

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

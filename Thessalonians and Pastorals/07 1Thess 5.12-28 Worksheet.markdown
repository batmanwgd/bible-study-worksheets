**Worksheet \#7: 1 Thessalonians 5:12–28 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">(NKJV)</span>**

And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, ^13^ and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.

^14^ Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all. ^15^ See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.

^16^ Rejoice always, ^17^ pray without ceasing, ^18^ in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

^19^ Do not quench the Spirit. ^20^ Do not despise prophecies. ^21^ Test all things; hold fast what is good. ^22 ^Abstain from every form of evil.

^23^ Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^24^ He who calls you *is* faithful, who also will do *it*.

^25^ Brethren, pray for us.

^26^ Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.

^27^ I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.

^28^ The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with you. Amen.

**Worksheet \#2: 2 John 1–13**

THE ELDER, To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth, ^2^ because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:

^3^ Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

^4^ I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father. ^5^ And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another. ^6^ This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.

^7^ For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. ^8^ Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.

^9^ Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. ^10^ If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; ^11^ for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.

^12^ Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

^13^ The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

Who might be “the elect lady and her children” in v. 1? [Hint: You may want to consult a study Bible or commentary on this topic.]

What does it mean to love “in truth” (v. 1)?

If the truth “abides” in us (v. 2), what might John mean when he speaks of “the truth”? How does the truth “abide” in us?

Notice the phrases used to refer to Christ in v. 3. What are these phrases, and what do they tell us about the writer’s view of Him?

Does the writer place more value on truth or love in verse 3? Explain your answer, and reflect on what that means for daily Christian life.

Based on vv. 4–6, what seems to be the content of the “commandment”? State the commandment in your own words, trying to include everything the writer says about it in these verses.

Who are the “deceivers” described in v. 7? What is John describing when he says that “*this* is a deceiver and an antichrist” (my emphasis)?

The word translated “abide” (vv. 2, 9) can also be translated “remain” or “stay.” How does that help explain v. 9? Restate what John means in this verse.

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

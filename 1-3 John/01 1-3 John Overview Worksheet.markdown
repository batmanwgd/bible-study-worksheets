**Worksheet 1: Overview of 1-3 John**

**Background**

*You may want to consult a study Bible or Bible dictionary for help with these questions.*

1.  Who is the human author of these letters? What do we know about him? (his background, his ministry, his culture)

2.  Who are the recipients of these letters? What do we know about them? (their relationship to the author, their circumstances, their relationship to God, their relationship to each other)

**Major Themes**

*Read through 1–3 John in one sitting (takes about 20 minutes) and then answer the next few questions.*

1.  Why were these letters written? (Is the author addressing problems? Is his tone encouraging or confrontational? Does the author seem to have a primary purpose?)

2.  Using a set of colored pencils, highlight any repeated themes that you can find in 1 John. Can you identify two or three prominent themes? Are there any themes that seem to be related to each other? Explain.

3.  What topics from the text are you excited about discussing in the next 12 weeks?

4.  What questions do you have after reading through this book?

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Outline of Mark’s Gospel</span>**[^1]

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The First Half of Mark’s Gospel: Jesus as the Powerful Messiah (1:1–8:26)</span>

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Second Half of Mark’s Gospel: Jesus as the Suffering Son of God (8:27–16:8)</span>

Note that Williams does not include 16:9-20 in his outline because he prefers the short ending of Mark. In the simplified outline in our Overview worksheets, I have inserted an additional point *H. Appearances to Disciples (16:9-20)* to include the traditional ending.

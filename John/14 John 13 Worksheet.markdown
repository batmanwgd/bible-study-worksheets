**Worksheet \#14: John 13:1–38**

**Summary:** Chapter 13 opens the second major portion of John’s gospel. In this section, Jesus’ focus turns from public confrontation with the Jews to private investment in his disciples to prepare them for what is to come. Rather than performing signs, Jesus is now focused upon the cross. Chapters 13–17 emphasize the preparation of the disciples. In chapter 13, Jesus demonstrates his love to them in the footwashing (13:1–17), after which Judas departs (13:18–30). After Judas’ departure, Jesus introduces the theme of his own departure, which introduces his Farewell Discourse (13:31–38).

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

How does 13:1 state the theme for John 13–17? What elements in this verse remind us of prior statements in the gospel? What is “the end” that John describes here (cf. 19:30)?

Notice the sequence of details presented in 13:2–3. How do these three facts help us to understand Jesus’ act in 13:4–5?

Consider the conversation between Jesus and John in 13:25–26. Based on the information in 13:27–30, what does this suggest about John’s understanding at the time?

In what sense could Jesus claim to be glorified “now” (13:31)?

What is “new” about the command Jesus gives in 13:34–35 (cf. 1 John 2:7–8)?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

According to Jesus’ explanation in 13:12–17, his followers are blessed when they “do” that which they “know” as a result of the footwashing. What are some ways you could exercise humility in your own life?

What does this passage tell us about Jesus? How does it help us to understand “his place in the sweep of redemptive history”?[^2]

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

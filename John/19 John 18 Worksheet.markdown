**Worksheet \#19: John 18:1–40**

**Summary:** Chapter 18 begins John’s Crucifixion account with Jesus’ arrest and trials. Of course, the Crucifixion is the signal event recounted in all four Gospels, described by Jesus in this gospel as his “hour” (17:1). Although repeatedly found innocent (18:38; 19:4, 6), Jesus died in fulfillment of Messianic prophecy (19:24, 28–29, 36–37). Here we read this great story.

John continues to provide a unique perspective in his own account, deemphasizing details present in the Synoptic gospels while including information that we have nowhere else. For example, John’s account of the betrayal and arrest emphasizes Christ’s knowledge of the sovereign plan (18:4–8), while the Synoptic accounts describe the betrayer’s kiss (Matt. 26:48–50; Mark 14:44–46; Luke 22:47–48). All four gospels mention Peter’s use of the sword, but only John names the high priest’s servant (John 18:10).

After the arrest, John tells of a preliminary hearing before Annas, father-in-law to the current high priest Caiaphas (John 18:12–14, 19–24). This questioning is not included in the Synoptic accounts. Peter’s denial of Jesus is interspersed in the account of this trial (18:15–18, 25–27). John provides only abbreviated references to the later trial before Caiaphas (18:24, 28), and instead focuses on the trial before Pilate (18:28–19:16a).

I.  EPILOGUE: THE COMPLEMENTARY ROLES OF PETER AND THE BELOVED DISCIPLE (21)

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

Notice that Judas is accompanied by a large company of troops and Jewish officials (18:3). Why might this be necessary for the arrest of a single individual?

Notice how Jesus is described in 18:4. What does this tell us about his attitude toward his impending death?

Notice Jesus’ response to Annas (18:20–21). If Jesus’ teachings were well known, what might have been Annas’ motive for inquiring about them (18:19)?

John mentions that one of the servants to who questions Peter is “a relative of him whose ear Peter cut off” and claimed to have seen Peter in the garden (18:26). What does this reveal about the nature of Peter’s denials?

Based on the context in 18:30–32, was Pilate’s question in 18:29 ever clearly answered by the Jews? With that in mind, what seems to be Pilate’s goal as he questions Jesus in 18:33–38a?

In what sense is Jesus’ kingdom “not of this world” and “not from here” (18:36)? How does 1 John 5:4 help us understand this text?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

What does this passage tell us about Jesus? How does it help us to understand “his place in the sweep of redemptive history”?[^2]

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

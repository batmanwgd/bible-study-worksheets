**Worksheet \#2: John 1:1–51**

**Summary:** John introduces his gospel with a glorious prologue (1:1–18) that describes the doctrine of Christ’s incarnation with precise language. The incarnation, foundational as it is for so many other doctrines, is challenging to explain. In this passage, each word serves a specific purpose. J. C. Ryle observes this effect when he remarks that “not a single word could be altered in the first five verses of St. John’s Gospel, without opening the door to some heresy.”[^1]

Following v. 18, we have two sections that narrate events from Jesus’ first week in public ministry. After the highly theological prologue, this passage places Jesus’ ministry within the context of history. The passage begins with the preaching of John the Baptist, calling the Jews to repentance and proclaiming Jesus as the “lamb of God” and the “Son of God” (1:19-34). Then, in 1:35–51, Jesus begins by recruiting disciples to participate in his public ministry.

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

In what sense does life reside in Christ, and how does his life provide light to men (1:4)?

What does it mean for John to come as a “witness” to Christ (1:6)? How does he understand his own role as a witness (1:19–27)?

What does it mean to have “the right to become children of God” (1:12)? How is that right acquired?

In 1:16, the preposition “for” (found in the phrase “grace *for* grace”) literally means “upon.” How does Christ’s coming result in God’s grace being accumulated upon more grace?

What does it mean for Jesus to be the “only begotten” Son (1:14, 18; cf. 3:16, 18)? What would it mean if he were *not* the “only begotten”?

What gave authority to John’s witness (1:32–34)?

Notice how the early disciples respond to Jesus by identifying him as the Messiah (1:41, 45, 47–49). How did they come to this conclusion, and how could they be so confident about it?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

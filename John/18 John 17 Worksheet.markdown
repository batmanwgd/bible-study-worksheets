**Worksheet \#17: John 17:1–26**

**Summary:** John 17 serves as a transition in John’s gospel between the Farewell Discourse proper and the account of Jesus’ crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. This chapter records one of Jesus’ prayers as he anticipates what is soon to come, and it is remarkable both as the longest of Jesus’ recorded prayers and for the insight it provides into Jesus’ own consciousness of what would soon come to pass. The passage breaks down simply into three sections. Jesus first prays for himself (17:1–5), then for his disciples (17:6–19), and finally for all others who would later believe in his name (17:20–26).

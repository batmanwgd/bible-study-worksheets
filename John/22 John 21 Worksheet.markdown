**Worksheet \#22: John 21:1–25**

**Summary:** Serving as an epilogue to John’s gospel, John 21 pairs with the prologue in John 1:1–18 to form a symmetrical “frame” around the main narrative, providing thematic unity. Although this “second ending” may seem redundant after the apparent conclusion in 20:30–31, it serves several necessary functions. For instance, the passage resolves the seemingly competitive relationship between Peter and the beloved disciple while also providing a smoother ending than would an abrupt stop immediately after the confrontation with Thomas in 20:26–29.[^1]

The chapter records three incidents from a day of fishing in Galilee (*cf.* 6:1, where the “Sea of Tiberius” equals Galilee). On this day, Jesus appears to his disciples in the third post-resurrection appearance to the disciples recorded in this gospel (21:14).

A key figure in this chapter is Simon Peter, prominent in all four gospels as outspoken leader among the disciples. Here, it is Peter who initiates the fishing expedition (21:3); it is Peter who first responds when the disciples recognize the Lord (21:7); it is Peter who drags in the abundant catch (21:11); and it is Peter with whom the Lord carries on most of the recorded conversation (21:15–19). Three times the Lord asks Peter to affirm his love, which serves to rehabilitate Peter after the three denials (18:12–27).

Throughout the chapter, the “disciple whom Jesus loved” is right behind Peter at each moment. He appears in the list of disciples as one of “the sons of Zebedee” (21:2); he identifies Jesus on the shore (21:7); and he becomes the primary focus in the closing remarks (21:20–25). In an important statement, he identifies himself as the author of the gospel and an eyewitness of “many other things that Jesus did” not recorded elsewhere (21:24–25).

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

How many indications can you find of God’s sovereign oversight in the disciples’ fishing excursion (21:1–13)? What seems to have been the purpose of divine intervention in this event?

Notice the awkwardness as the disciples come ashore (21:12). Why does John point this out to us? What does it tell us about this moment?

Compare John 21:15–17 with 1 Peter 5:1–3. How did Peter understand his mission, and what does that mean for others entrusted with the care of God’s flock?

Why is it significant that Jesus predicted the manner of Peter’s death in 21:18–19?

Compare John 21:24 with 1 John 1:1–3 and 4:14ff. Why is it significant for the author of this gospel to have been an eyewitness?

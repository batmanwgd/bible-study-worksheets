**Worksheet \#7: John 6:1–71**[^1]

**Summary:** Chapter six brings us to the midpoint in the Book of Signs, and also to a watershed moment in the life of Jesus. Many details appear in the chapter, which begins with the fifth Johannine sign—the feeding of the 5,000 from a young man’s lunch (6:1–14). With thorough coverage in all the Synoptic gospels (Matthew 14:13–23; Mark 6:31–46; Luke 9:10–17), the feeding miracle is one of the most familiar episodes in Jesus’ public ministry. In John’s account, it is closely followed by another miracle, as Jesus walks on the turbulent waters of the Sea of Galilee (John 6:15–21). The walking on water is not the evangelist’s primary concern, however, serving instead as an interlude before the extended “Bread of Life” discourse (6:22–59) that unpacks the significance of the aforementioned sign. The discourse proves to be decisive. Many “disciples” reject Jesus (6:60–66), while the Twelve remain apparently committed to Jesus (6:67–71). The loyalty of the Twelve is mixed, of course. Juxtaposed against Peter’s confession of faith is the ominous foreshadowing of Judas’ later apostasy, which elevates the tension as the overarching narrative proceeds.

I.  EPILOGUE: THE COMPLEMENTARY ROLES OF PETER AND THE BELOVED DISCIPLE (21)

Interpretation: *Read through the passage, and then review and make notes under the questions below.*

Notice how the crowd identifies Jesus as “the Prophet” (6:14) and then desires to make him their “king” (6:15). What led them to this, and what seems to have been their motivation for making Jesus their “king”?

Why does Jesus talk about the things the crowd should “labor” for in 6:27, and what does it mean to “labor… for the food which endures to everlasting life”?

In 6:34, does the crowd understand what Jesus said in 6:32–33? What might they mean by “this bread” in 6:34?

What part of the statement “I am the bread which came down from heaven” (6:41) seems to have been most objectionable to the crowd, and why? Which part of the statement does Jesus emphasize in 6:43–51, and why?

How does Jesus’ emphasis in 6:43–51 produce the reaction in 6:52? How does Jesus’ explanation in 6:53–58 capitalize upon and further aggravate the Jews’ misunderstanding?

In what sense are Jesus’ comments in 6:61–65 addressed to the crowd? In what sense are they addressed to the Twelve?

To what extent does Peter’s confession in 6:68 indicate understanding? Does it also include some misunderstanding?

Application: *Take time to reflect on the implications of this passage for your own life today.*

What does this passage tell us about Jesus? How does it help us to understand “his place in the sweep of redemptive history”?[^3]

What does this passage mean for your walk with the Lord?

How does this passage challenge the way you think about situations in daily life? What should you do about that?

[^1]: Some may have noticed that the original schedule published on “Worksheet 1: Overview of John’s Gospel” indicated that we would divide chapter six into two studies, with the first covering verses 1–21 and the second covering the remainder. This plan has been discarded, however, since doing so would sever the integrally related events of the chapter from their obvious context, thus obscuring the impact intended by the evangelist.

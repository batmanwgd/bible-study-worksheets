**Worksheet \#17: John 16:1–33**

**Summary:** In John 16, Jesus turns his focus toward his soon departure and the subsequent coming of the Spirit. In verses 1–16, he provides continued instruction on the role of the Spirit (described again in 16:7 as the *paráklētos*). A time of intense persecution will come upon the church (16:1–4), which will itself demonstrate that the world hates the church because it serves a different master (15:18–19). In 16:5–16, Jesus explains that his impending departure is to the advantage of the church, because it ushers in the new age of the Spirit’s work in believer’s lives. Verses 17–18 provide a natural transition, revealing the disciples’ misunderstanding of Jesus’ departure. Jesus addresses this misunderstanding by comparing the disciples’ present confusion and dismay to the pain of childbirth, which (though excruciating for a time) leads to joy (16:19–22). Although very soon the disciples will no longer have Jesus present with them, this is not a disadvantage. In the new day following Jesus’ departure, the disciples will instead have the ability to pray the Father in the name of Jesus, the Son, because the Son will be present with the Father (16:23–28). In response, the disciples claim to understand and believe, yet Jesus observes that they will soon flee him while he overcomes the world (16:29–33).

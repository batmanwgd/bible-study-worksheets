**Worksheet \#8: John 7:1–53**

**Summary:** Chapters 7 and 8 include a cycle of events set in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles. The cycle is introduced with a brief account of controversy within Jesus’ family (7:1–9), as his brothers attempt to convince him to seek public notoriety. In so doing, the brothers demonstrate their own misunderstanding and rejection of Jesus and his mission. The rest of the chapter describes Jesus’ public teaching in the temple. The passage accomplishes two purposes, showing first that “Jesus fulfills the symbolism underlying [the Feast of Tabernacles],” but also “featuring representative questions regarding Jesus’ messiahship” that serve to guide us as we evaluate the things Jesus said about himself.[^1]
